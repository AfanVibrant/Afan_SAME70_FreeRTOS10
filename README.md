# INTRODUCTION
Without permission, do not commit the code to FreeRTOS mainline.
## Project Backgroud 项目背景
This project provides a simple FreeRTOS V10.xx RTOS demo on Microchip SAME70Q21.
All Afan RTOS repositories(FreeRTOS/uC/OS-II/uC/OS-III/RT-Thread/ThreadX) all
shares the same BSP from repository <https://github.com/AfanVibrant/Afan_SAME70_BSP.git>.

You can use free tools to develop, compile and debug this project on Microchip
ATSAME70Q21(ARM Cortex-M7 Core) MCU. As a MCU developer, I prefer to use 3rd part
free IDE and tools with my work, to be honest some MCU vendor's IDEs are not easy to use.
It's more convinient for me to use the same tools/IDE to finish the work with
different MCU.

There is no plan to provide other IDE, such as IAR or Keil support for there sereies
projects, I have no license for such tools and there are also too expensive for me.

Tools used for this project are as following (using Windows as example):
  - IDE: Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++ Developers with Version: 2021-03 (4.19.0).
  - Cross-compile Tool: xpack-arm-none-eabi-gcc-10.2.1-1.1-win32-x64.
  - Windows Build Tool: xpack-windows-build-tools-4.2.1-2-win32-x64.
  - Windows Debug Tool: xpack-openocd-0.11.0-1-win32-x64.
  - Hardware Debugger:  CMSIS-DAP Tools or J-Link.

Project Components:
  - BSP files of ATSAME70Q21 are configured and generated from <https://start.atmel.com/>.
  - Please download project BSP file from <https://github.com/AfanVibrant/Afan_SAME70_BSP.git>.
  - All projects (FreeRTOS/RT-Thread/ThreadX/uC-OS2/uC-OS3) share the same BSP project.
  - For this repository, is based on FreeRTOS. <https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS.git>.

## FreeRTOS Introduction

# DEVELOPMENT

So before you download this repo, please download SAME70 BSP from following link :
	<https://github.com/AfanVibrant/Afan_SAME70_BSP.git>.

## Project Cross-Compiling

Following these steps (using Windows10 for example):
  - Downloading Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++ Developers with Version: 2021-03.
  - Downloading Cross-compile Tool: xpack-arm-none-eabi-gcc-10.2.1-1.1-win32-x64.
  - Downloading Windows Build Tool: xpack-windows-build-tools-4.2.1-2-win32-x64.
  - Downloading Windows Debug Tool: xpack-openocd-0.11.0-1-win32-x64.
  - Unzip all needed tools as mentioned before.
  - From Help directory you can get more details of setting up development environments.
  - Rename downloaded project name from Afan_SAME70_xxx to Afan SAME70 xxx(replace '_' by space).
  - Import Afan SAME70 BSP to your Eclipse IDE first before import other RTOS project.

## Project Debugging
